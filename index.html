            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My life’s journey is about overcoming self-doubt and conquering my greatest enemy, myself. I will be a person remembered not only for my determination and perspectives but also with laughter and funny stories that show who I truly am. My most important contribution to the people closest to me will be the advice and insight I share and the new perspectives I give them. To fully realize this mission, I will prioritize reading and working out and build my mind and body up as I get older. </p>
